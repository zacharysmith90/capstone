      <h1>No One Told Me What Infertility Would Be Like For a Black Man. <br> That's Because Nobody Knows.</h1>
      
      <p class="byline">By K. Jared Wright and Zachary Smith</p>
      
      <div class="dek">
        <p>On the morning of Nov. 25, 2020, I found myself sitting in a fertility clinic waiting to deposit semen that would be sent to a laboratory to test my sperm count. This would be the fifth and final time after a gauntlet of errors and shuffling between different clinics. As I looked around the waiting room, it dawned on me: as with each visit to a clinic before this moment, I was the only Black man there. </p>

        <p>I am a 34-year-old, 6-foot-3 Black man who weighed over 330 pounds at the time. Sitting in an Asian-run laboratory in Manhattan specializing in fertility treatments, I definitely stood out. What&rsquo;s more, other than the nurses who took vitals and blood samples, none of the medical professionals were Black.</p>
        
        <p>For any Black person, being the only one in the room is not an unfamiliar situation. But on the cusp of life-altering news, I realized that this was more than that. I was not privy to any discussions about struggles to start a family in the Black community, and I didn&rsquo;t know of any resources I could turn to for guidance.</p>
        
        <p>I was eventually diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia &ndash; the absence of and failure to produce sperm in my ejaculate considered the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5715857/#:~:text=Non%E2%80%90obstructive%20azoospermia%20(NOA),impairment%20or%20inadequate%20gonadotropin%20production.">most severe iteration of male infertility</a>. From the moment I received my diagnosis, it was clear that there was a stark disparity in the fertility healthcare system regarding representation and viable options available to Black men.</p>
        
        <p>Infertility is typically associated with women. Copious studies, websites, and consultants are dedicated to female infertility. For men, however, the conversations are few and the support scarce. Resources that talk specifically about Black men are nearly nonexistent.</p>
        
        <p>I would love to mention a statistic about being &ldquo;one of the X percent&rdquo; of Black men who have infertility, but that number is relatively unknown. There is a lack of studies on whether infertility affects black men more or differently than other ethnicities. On the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, the only mention of male infertility is in a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/infertility/infertility-white-paper/page-one.htm">2008 report</a>. The Department of Health and Human Services mentions male infertility only <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/infertility">in a few FAQ&rsquo;s</a> for the Office on Women&rsquo;s Health. Neither mention race nor ethnicity in any capacity.</p>
        
        <p>If you informally google &ldquo;black male infertility&rdquo; or something similar, you&rsquo;d only come across a few studies, one of which is more of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6984439/">a focus group</a> than a study. There is also not much discussion on Black male infertility on social media. An informal Instagram search of #infertility shows just under 2 million posts. Search for #maleinfertility, and you will see just under 60,000 posts. When you search for #blackmaleinfertility, 19 posts are visible.</p>
        
        <p>On my journey to having a child, my wife and I have explored every option, and at each turn, I felt like the only Black man in every room. From medical research and support to sperm banks and fertility clinics, there has been a lack of conversation and resources to help me cope with my infertility.</p>
        
        <p>So let&rsquo;s talk about it. </p>
      </div>
      
    </div>

<div class="container">

      <h3>The Line Went Dead</h3>
      <p>My mother will tell you that if there were an ailment a child could get, I likely would have had it. I have had a number of operations on my left ear to treat my inability to hear out of that side of my head, and I will never forget when a rogue intestinal polyp directly resulted in eight pints of lost blood. Still, she and I both never would have imagined this diagnosis, especially since we were promised otherwise.</p>    
      
      <p>At birth, my urethra was not at the tip of my penis, a condition known as hypospadias. My urethra had to be reconstructed, and my doctor, Moneer Hanna, told my mother the surgery would not impact my fertility as an adult, which he stands by to this day. Some in the medical community claim hypospadias can cause infertility, while some studies find the connection to be inconclusive.</p>
      
      <p>So I never had reason to suspect anything would be wrong. No man can predict if he will struggle with infertility, and most men, including me, don&rsquo;t see a urologist as an adult for the first time until something seems wrong. Even then, a problem may not be detectable at first glance.</p>
      
      <p>Before we even began trying for a baby, my wife Erica suspected that there might be a fertility issue regarding thin semen and irregular ejaculation, and insisted I get tested before we became a couple whose lives revolved around trying to have a baby to no avail. Because of this, I spent a good amount of time through the early stages of this journey, marching from medical lab to medical lab, wanting an answer about my fertility.</p>
      
      <p>Even after a CT scan to see if there were any notable issues, my urologist at the time said everything looked normal. I persisted in telling my wife everything was fine, but she still wanted me to have a semen analysis.</p>
      
      <p>A semen analysis tests the amount of sperm in a man&rsquo;s semen. As I mentioned, the results were so alarming that my urologist dropped me because my sperm count was so low it was undetectable by the analysis. I virtually had no sperm in my ejaculate, and he felt moving forward with me was beyond his purview. When I asked if he could refer me to anyone, I was simply told no, and the line went dead.</p>

      <div class="container image header">
        <img src="images/semen_analysis.PNG" alt="Jared's final semen analysis results" />
        <p class="caption">K. Jared Wright's final semen analysis results.</p>
      
      </div>

      <p>Eventually, after several subsequent semen analyses, my primary care provider referred me to Dr. Boback Berookhim with Northwell Fertility in midtown Manhattan. Two operations followed, which would eventually equate to nearly $50,000 of billables to my insurance company in an attempt to optimize the little sperm I was working with.</p>
      
      <p>The first was a varicocelectomy, a procedure that reduces large, wide veins in the scrotum, hindering sperm production. This allowed for the best opportunity to extract sperm for the subsequent micro-TESE.</p>
      
      <p>A micro-TESE, or a microscopic-assisted testicular sperm extraction, removes sperm directly from the testicles, providing the most efficient chance at finding sperm to be used in subsequent in vitro fertilization (IVF). From the micro-TESE, the testicular tissue is frozen in anticipation of fertilizing recovered sperm with eggs retrieved from a female partner for potential embryo implantation.</p>

        <p class="caption">K. Jared Wright's micro-TESE results.</p>
      
      </div>

      <p>In short, this was the best chance for my wife to become pregnant with my sperm.</p>
      
      <p>The whole process was alienating. This was an invasive procedure involving some of the most delicate parts of my anatomy. Additionally, I felt like I was stripped of my biological purpose, forced to resort to white-walled laboratories to execute what I could not do on my own.</p>
      
      <p>Not having any resources to turn to or a community that could offer consultation left me with more questions than answers. Why wasn&rsquo;t there representation for black male infertility, and why was my community not equipped to help me?</p>
    
    </div>
    
      <div class="container relative">
      <h3>A White Man's Disease</h3>
      
      <p>I appreciated the support I was getting from people close to me, but it was difficult when they would tell me &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be good&rsquo; or &lsquo;everything will be okay&rsquo; when they had no idea what it meant to deal with infertility in the first place. Exactly how would I &ldquo;be good&rdquo;?</p>
      
      <p>But what could they say? Male infertility was never discussed in my family or among my friends, and there wasn&rsquo;t representation in the media growing up outside of the occasional commercial about medications for erectile dysfunction, a disorder that many people incorrectly associate with infertility to this day.</p>
      
      <p> Dr. Ronald Anglade, one of few Black urologists in the United States, says even getting somebody to be evaluated can take coaching, never mind talking about it with their peers.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I think in couples of color, I would say that infertility still sort of has a stigma attached to it, particularly for the male,'' says Dr. Anglade. &ldquo;I think that men of color really feel that their virility or their ability to father children is very important.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Upon my diagnosis, I searched for information regarding male infertility to share with my family. However, in my search for literature to educate myself and others, I did not see any people of color.</p>
      
      <p>A common term in academic recruitment is &ldquo;three and a tree.&rdquo; Marketing materials aimed to recruit students to colleges have students of varying ethnicities and gender sitting under a tree somewhere on campus to show student body diversity. I didn&rsquo;t even get that.</p>
      
      <p>The images of men I saw in any male infertility literature and other materials consisted of white doctors and white men. We barely discuss male infertility as it is, but even when we do, the conversation sways white.</p>
      
      <p>Some in my own family struggle with my diagnosis, often oscillating between whether or not I am infertile. When I want to discuss what I am going through, they tend not to want to hear it or only listen to me talk about what I&rsquo;m going through for as long as they can stomach it.</p>

          <p class="caption">Listen to my parents speak about how they believe they support me and their struggles with my diagnosis.</p>

          <p>As they have been about most things in my life, my parents have been very supportive throughout this process. At one point, my father even offered to be a sperm donor if I wanted it as an option. Even so, the lack of discussion in my family is tantamount to the radio silence I have seen throughout researching Black male infertility.</p>

          <p>The sentiment in my family is not an anomaly. The lack of discussion about infertility and other health issues for the Black community can be attributed to a distrust in the medical system stemming from generations of abuse.</p>        
</div>
<div class= "container relative">
        
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this huge legacy of mistrust that goes back to persons with syphilis being studied,&rdquo; says Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey, MD, a Black reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist with Reproductive Medical Associates of New York, referring to the <a href="http://cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">USPHS Syphilis Study at Tuskegee</a>. &ldquo;This experiment was not about vaccinations. It was actually about preventing access to cures that were determined during the course of the study of what happens with syphilis.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>In her book Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans From Colonial Times to the Present (Doubleday, 2007), Harriet Washington highlights systemic experimentation on Black patients, including how clinics fitted more African-American women than white women with intrauterine devices (IUDs).   These two medical experiments on Black people are only a few of many that have incubated beliefs that the federal government attempted to stifle Black population growth.   &ldquo;A history of forcible sterilization fed suspicions that the federally financed birth-control clinics in their neighborhoods were attempts to discover the best way to limit or even erase the black presence in America,&rdquo; Washington wrote (p.198).</p>
  
  <p>But don&rsquo;t take my word for it. Mike Gray is the only Black man I found who agreed to go on record for this story, but his name has been changed to keep him anonymous. Gray, an educator in Atlanta, says it is important that he remain anonymous because he does not want his infertility to be the defining point in his life.</p>
  
  <p>Mike was first diagnosed with infertility in 2013. He was diagnosed as having low testosterone and has been on various medications to increase testosterone in hopes of kickstarting his sperm production.</p>

      <p class="caption">Listen to Mike Gray (pseudonym) talk about being the only Black man he knows with infertility and his hesitancy to be open to others about his diagnosis. </p>

      <p>Despite not wanting to reveal himself, Gray wants a conversation around the topic so that Black men can find help and resources.</p>   
      
      <p>&ldquo;I would definitely love for African-American male infertility to be a topic of discussion, and for there to be light brought to the issue,&rdquo; Gray says. &ldquo;Just being able to Google and seeing something like &lsquo;15% of African American men have this condition&rsquo; &ndash; to see this statistic or something to know that I'm not alone.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Gray was the first Black man I ever spoke to who knew what I was going through. He says he has not encountered other Black men in a similar situation, either. In fact, before his diagnosis, he didn&rsquo;t believe Black men could be infertile.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I feel like I have a white man&rsquo;s disease,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I'm Black. But, am I really? I didn&rsquo;t even know infertility for a man existed, let alone a Black man.&rdquo;</p>
  
</div>
<div class="container relative">
  <p>Between my operations, my wife and I started looking at potential sperm donors if we could not have our own children. And there, too, we found ourselves navigating another disappointing landscape for Black families seeking medical help to conceive.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h3>A Child Like Us</h3>

      <p>Thirty-eight.</p>    
      
      <p>That number will come into play shortly.</p>   
      
      <p>As the reality of my diagnosis set in, my wife came home one day in early 2021 with information on sperm banks in case we needed to find a donor as an alternative option to conceive a child. My wife is white, I am Black, and we wanted a child like us. We needed to find a Black sperm donor, but when we looked at four of the major sperm banks in the country, we were alarmed.</p>   
      
      <p> Between California Cryobank, Xytex, Seattle Sperm Bank, and Fairfax Cryobank, we found that there were a vast number of white donors to examine, with numbers into the thousands. The number of black donors? Thirty-eight.</p>
      
      <p>How could there be so few?   Michelle Ottey, laboratory director for Fairfax Cryobank, says <a href="https://www.audiofilespodcast.com/2021/12/11/infertility-struggle/">there are immense difficulties obtaining donors from communities of color</a>.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;It's just really difficult to even get guys to want to talk about it,&rdquo; Ottey says. &ldquo;And then there seems to be a lot of skepticism about it. I think a lot of that is because there's not enough conversation about it.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Becoming a donor is already a highly selective process, but multiple sperm banks insist I ethnicity is not a factor. Ottey says 90% of all potential donors are eliminated because of high-risk behaviors determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as displaying a history of medical instability, or my arch-nemesis, low sperm count.</p>
      
      <p>For the few who do make it through, the entire process takes an average of four to six weeks. After that, it can still take months for a donor to make it into a catalog.</p>
      
      <p>Sperm banks typically recruit directly from the area where they are located, with targeting local college campuses a popular tactic.</p>
      
      <p>Corey Burke, tissue director of Cryos International, says his sperm bank has tried to recruit from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU), including Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Fla. When we reached out to confirm with the HBCUs, the representative from Bethune-Cookman University called our editor, asking if our inquiry was legitimate. The rest didn&rsquo;t answer at all.</p>
      
      <p>Local recruitment makes sense for sperm donors because the less time spent transferring sperm, the better. Despite sperm banks being spread throughout the country, their donor demographic makeup is astonishingly white&mdash; even in locations with substantial Black populations.</p>
      
      <p>For some sperm banks, this makes sense. For instance, Seattle Sperm Bank has 2.5 percent Black donors in their catalog. While not great, King County, Washington where they are located only has a 7 percent Black population</p>
      
      <p>Conversely, Xytex Corporation, a sperm bank in Atlanta, has less than 2 percent Black donors in their catalog. According to the latest census information, 51 percent of the population in Atlanta is Black. Xytex has not responded to requests for comment.  </p>
      
      <div class="container chart">
        <iframe title="Black Men Make Fewer Than 10% of Sperm Donors" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Q0QAv" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q0QAv/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="328"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
        </script>
      </div>

      <p>This scarcity can create obstacles for would-be parents. Sperm donated by Black men sells out after only a few days listed in a sperm bank&rsquo;s catalog, leaving other clients on waitlists until the bank finds another suitable donor, says Angelo Allard, a general supervisor of Seattle Sperm Bank. And while the situation is tenuous in the United States, it is dire internationally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Europe is very, very desperate, not just desperate for donors, but for Black sperm donors,&rdquo; Burke says. &ldquo;We're just not able to fill out requests worldwide. We can't get [donors] in Denmark, we can't get them in other European locations, and we can't get them in our three locations we have in the US.&rdquo; Other sperm banks say they are struggling to meet the demand for sperm from Black donors.</p>

      <img src="images/internationalrequest.png" alt="International email request" />
      <p class = "caption">An email request to Seattle Sperm bank from an international outfit specifically requesting Black sperm donors. </p>
    

      <p>&ldquo;People don't realize how much need and desire there is for people, you know, to build their families with donors that look like them, with donors that share their cultural heritage and their ethnic background,&rdquo; Ottey says.</p>

      <p>While Burke acknowledges that donor recruitment strategies haven't changed much in the last 30 years, some sperm banks are trying to be creative in their marketing. Burke has tried setting up a tent at a local music concert, and Ottey says she is seeking to increase the number of Black donors through social media influencers.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;We're really trying to sort of reach out that way because that's the demographic that we have the most success with; 21 to 29 are the majority of our active donors,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And they're the ones who are using social media platforms for everything, not just friendship interactions.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>A Barrier to Entry</h3>

      <p>My micro-TESE was a success, meaning we could proceed with IVF. The sperm that was successfully extracted from my testicles could fertilize the six viable embryos surgically removed from my wife. Those two operations cost thousands of dollars, but I am fortunate enough to live in New York and have an insurance plan with high limits covering fertility treatments. For many others, this is not the reality.</p>

<p>Dr. Anglade points out that cost is a huge barrier to entry for IVF for the vast majority, especially for low-income patients without insurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We find a lot of people who are limited in the avenues that they can pursue based on the cost,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of these procedures which are quite costly and generally not covered by insurance. Financially, if you can't afford it, it&rsquo;s very challenging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I had not had insurance, I would have paid $50,000 out of pocket just to be told if any sperm existed. Another $55,000 went into the egg retrieval and one round of implantations. This is not money an average American family has on hand and sets a significant disadvantage for Black Americans, whose median income of $38,600, according to a <a href="https://www2.census.gov/ces/opportunity/race_and_econ_opp_slides.pdf">2018 report</a> by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<p>IVF costs on average well over $20,000 when you factor in the procedure, medication, and consultation, according to <a href="https://www.fertilityiq.com/">FertilityIQ</a>. And while its success rates are three to five times higher than for other fertility options like intrauterine insemination, it is five to forty times more costly. Because the average fertility patient will undergo multiple rounds of IVF, cumulative costs can range from $40,000 to $60,000.</p>

<p>The interactive graph below displays each bill my insurance company received for my two operations and my wife&rsquo;s egg extraction, and one round of IVF. For a man in New York, this is what the cost of fertility can look like. This is a low estimate of costs, as insurance companies do not track copays and other out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

In 2020, the New York State legislature passed <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/a7478/amendment/a">Assembly Bill A7478A</a>, mandating that large group insurance plans cover IVF and that all insurers cover medically necessary fertility preservation (freezing eggs or sperm). This fertility coverage is one of the most advanced s in the country. <a href="https://www.reproductivefacts.org/resources/state-infertility-insurance-laws/states/georgia/">There is no coverage mandate</a> for infertility treatments in Georgia, where Mike Gray lives. That is the case for <a href="https://resolve.org/what-are-my-options/insurance-coverage/infertility-coverage-state/">19 states</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Alukal, a South Indian urologist at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center, says this is a conversation amongst his field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of colleagues I'm really proud of around the country have been looking at issues of access to fertility care, and the obvious kind of the disproportionate burden that patients of color bear in terms of not having the same access to fertility coverage to their insurance and not being able to pay out of pocket for procedures,&rdquo; Dr. Alukal said. &ldquo;What do we do to make this kind of care &ndash; access to needs &ndash; to be more equitable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A patient advocacy group, <a href="https://resolve.org/">RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association</a>, pushes for fertility assistance policies at both state and national levels, including those influencing insurance coverage of infertility treatments, <a href="https://resolve.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ResolveAnnualReport_2019-min.pdf">reporting on 77 bills</a> in total from 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>Couples can also <a href="https://resolve.org/what-are-my-options/making-infertility-affordable/infertility-treatment-grants-scholarships/">apply for grants</a> from organizations like the <a href="https://babyquestfoundation.org/">Baby Quest Foundation</a>, but many such grants have restrictions based on faith, location, or specific steps in the process. Even then, relying on donations is a risky endeavor that may never go in a patient's favor due to long waitlists and limited funds. Many fertility sites also offer loans, but options range from at-clinic loans to credit cards.</p>

<p>Still, aid to those who can&rsquo;t afford IVF on their own is limited, and in a country obsessed with whether a woman has a right to choose to have a baby, a whole population of would-be parents are blocked from starting families by lack of resources.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you say to one group of people, &lsquo;Unless you have enough money in your pocket, you can&rsquo;t have a kid?&rsquo; &rdquo; Dr. Alukal asks.</p>

<p> My wife and my first attempt at implantation failed. To try again will be at least another $8,000, which we will pursue because our insurance covers it. </p>

      <h3>On the Other Side</h3>

      <p>When TJ Peyten learned of her husband's infertility, she began journaling about the experience. Peyten says that encountering an infertility diagnosis was uncharted territory for her and her husband.</p>

      <p>The difficulties started immediately, as Peyten said she did not encounter other Black couples in a similar situation. So she turned her journal entries into a self-published book called <a class="book" href="https://semensecrets.com">Semen Secrets</a> and released it as a resource for other women in relationships with Black men who are infertile.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Prior to our diagnosis, we had not heard about infertility, at least amongst our friends and family,&rdquo; she says.</p>

      <div class="flex-pic ">
        <div class="flex-image">
         
      <p>&ldquo;In joining various groups with the infertility community, everyone was white,&rdquo; Peyten continues. &ldquo;As an African-American couple dealing with our specific type of infertility, it was important for me to&#8230; see if I could find other people that look like me who are dealing with it, but just not speaking up.&rdquo;</p> 

      <p>For Peyten and her husband, the infertility diagnosis had a high emotional cost.</p>    
  
  <p>&ldquo;We very much went through the stages of grief. We went through a period where we wanted to get a divorce,&rdquo; Peyten says. &#8203;&#8203;&rdquo;You go through all of these various emotions. Our relationship ebbed and flowed. When you have two people that are grieving, sometimes hurt people, hurt people.&rdquo; </p>

        <p class="caption">Listen to TJ Peyten talk about the need for early fertility education.</p>

        <p>Peyten and her husband eventually explored other means to have a child and adopted a daughter.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I was not going to let infertility ruin my life anymore,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If we were going to be childless, there has to be another purpose. Now we have our baby, and we are successfully parents. Not in the way we imagined, but definitely in a way that has brought us so much joy. Just being parents in our journey, we appreciate it so much more. Not to say that other parents don&rsquo;t appreciate it, but when you&rsquo;ve gone through something, it&rsquo;s just a different feeling when you come out on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Peyten says the taboo nature of infertility, particularly when it involves men in the Black community, is stifling and unproductive for people trying to manage this diagnosis.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;We hear about sperm donation, and it&rsquo;s a scary term,&rdquo; Peyten says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like somebody said they saw Bigfoot. It&rsquo;s definitely not something that a man, let alone a Black man, is going to jump into. There is probably a shortage of donors because of lack of education and knowledge about why sperm donation is needed, and the process of sperm donation. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen any education about sperm donation &ndash; what it is and what it isn't &ndash; outside of my husband and I exploring it because we had to.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Peyten also says infertility should be discussed more prominently at the high school level, where young people are coming into their own as people.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;Maybe in high school or early college, people should understand that you may need to freeze your eggs when you come out of school because you don&rsquo;t know, or if you&rsquo;re planning to be a father, you may need to get a semen analysis early on,&rdquo; Peyton says.</p>
      
      </div>
<div class="container relative">

        <p>Her words echo what Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey mentioned about lack of education at an early age. At the end of the day, when resources are needed from Black communities, there is always a way to extract them. But when it comes to bettering their health, the well dries up.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;There has to be some kind of a reckoning from the healthcare world at large,&rdquo; says Dr. Jackson-Bey. &ldquo;You see Army recruitment in every underserved Black and Brown community in this country, but nothing saying, &lsquo;Okay, come and have a fertility assessment.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Black health disparities are well known and documented in the United States. From heart disease to childbirth, demographic studies prove that Black Americans have lower mortality rates, reduced access to care, and delayed diagnoses. However, studies have also shown that minority patients benefit most from <a href="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/minority-patients-benefit-from-having-minority-doctors-but-thats-a-hard-match-to-make-0">consulting with minority doctors</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Black male infertility follows the same pattern of neglect. The difference is that Black fertility specialists are tough to come across. As I started this journey being the only Black man in the room, so it was the case every step along the way. I was never able to find a Black urologist, fertility clinic professional, or sperm bank representative.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the lack of representation, my wife and I persisted in our attempt to have a child that looked like us. However, the first attempt at an embryo transfer was unsuccessful, resulting in a loss. Although I would have liked to end this differently with an ultrasound picture or a positive pregnancy test, that is not the case. The difficulties I have encountered have been physical, emotional, and financial, and more representation throughout the journey could have alleviated some of the hardship.</p>
        
        <p>As my wife and I prepare to try again, my hope is this story shows other Black men that they are not alone. In the future, nobody should be the only Black man in the room. </p>
