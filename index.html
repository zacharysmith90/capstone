      <h1>No One Told Me What Infertility Would Be Like For a Black Man. That's Because Nobody Knows.</h1>
      <p class="byline">By K. Jared Wright and Zachary Smith</p>
      <p class="dek">A summary dek for what the reader is about to experience. You will laugh. You will cry. You will be angry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>[Anecdotal lede. Sitting in the fertility clinic, I look around and I notice that I am the only Black man in the facility. This is the &ldquo;X number&rdquo; of semen analysis I am participating in, and the situation is all the same. While I am waiting to hear a potentially life-altering diagnosis, I can&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;Why am I the only Black man here. ]</p>

<p>I am a black man who was diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia, which is considered <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5715857/#:~:text=Non%E2%80%90obstructive%20azoospermia%20(NOA),impairment%20or%20inadequate%20gonadotropin%20production."> the most severe iteration</a> of male infertility.</p>

<p>When people think about someone struggling with infertility, the focus is immediately shifted to women. For men, not only is a conversation few and far between, but resources and support are far more scarce. When discussed amongst black men, the scarcity is far more staggering.</p>

<p>I would love to mention a statistic about being one of the x-percentage of black men suffering from male infertility, but because it is not talked about, there is not even a remote clue as to how widespread of an issue this is.</p>

<p>There is not much in the way of discussion on black male infertility. To give you an idea, an informal Instagram search of #infertility shows just under 2 million posts. Search for #maleinfertility and you will see just under 60,000 posts. When you search for #blackmaleinfertility, 19 posts are visible.</p>

<p>This search parallelled my own life, where talking about my possibly infertility with another Black man outside of my family was nearly non-existent. Even when my wife and I started looking at potential sperm donors as a precaution, we found ourselves navigating the disappointing landscape of donor disparity alone.     Every step along the way, I felt like the only Black man in the room. From medical research and my family support system, to sperm banks and fertility clinics, there has been nobody for me to talk to that has experienced what I experienced.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>

</div>

      
<div class="container">

      <h3>Let me introduce myself</h3>
      <p>My mother will tell you that growing up, if it was an ailment for a child to get, then I likely had it. I have had a number of surgeries on my left due to my inability to hear out of that side of my head, and I will never forget the Summer in my late teens where I lost eight pints of blood. Still, I never would have imagined I would have been a black man suffering from infertility.    
      <p>From birth, I was born with a condition called hypospadias, and I had to get my urethra constructed. My mother was told that this would not impact my fertility as an adult, which is something my doctor stands by to this day.</p>    
      <p>Nobody knows if they are going to struggle with male infertility. Most men don&rsquo;t see a urologist for the first time unless something seems to be wrong, myself included. Even then, it may not always be detectable at first glance. At the behest of my wife, I spent a good amount of time through the early stages of this journey marching from medical lab to medical lab, wanting an answer on my fertility. I took a CAT scan early on in order to see if there were any noted issues. My urologist got back to us and said everything looked normal.</p>   
      <p>Subsequent to the CAT scan, my urologist dropped me and said I need to find a urologist who specializes in male fertility. When I asked if he could refer me anywhere, I was simply told &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the line went dead.</p>   
      <p>Through this setback, I was recommended by my PCP to get in touch with Dr. Boback Berookhim with Northwell Fertility. In 2020 and 2021, Dr. Berookhim performed a varicocele and Micro TESE, respectively.</p>

<p>In my attempt to have a child with my DNA, I had to have two surgeries in order to attempt to have this desire come to fruition&mdash; a varicocelectomy and a Micro TESE (testicular sperm extraction).</p>

<p>A varicocelectomy is a procedure that reduces large and wide veins on the scrotum, which can hinder the production of sperm.</p>

<p>A Micro TESE, or a microscope-assisted testicular sperm extraction, testicular tissue is retrieved and provides the most efficient chance at locating sperm to be used in subsequent in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. From the Micro TESE, the testicular tissue is frozen in anticipation of fertilizing recovered sperm with eggs that are retrieved from a female partner to use in a potential embryo implantation procedure.</p>

      <h3>A White Mans Disease</h3>
      
      <p>Through my journey, it has been especially difficult to find anyone to relate to. I loved the support I was getting from people close to me, but it was difficult when people would tell me &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll be good&rsquo; or &lsquo;everything will be okay&rsquo; when they had no idea what it meant to deal with it in the first place. Exactly how would I be good?</p>   
      <p>While experts concur that the need for a diverse pool of sperm donors is important, they similarly concur that there is no consensus reason as to why there are so few sperm donors of color, let alone Black donors.</p>   
      <p></p>&ldquo;I think in couples of color, I would say that infertility still sort of has a stigma attached to it, particularly for the male. I think that men of color really feel that their virility, or their ability to father children is very important. To want to take that step to be evaluated sometimes takes a little bit of coaching,&rdquo; says urologist Dr. Ronald Anglade.</p>  
      <p>In her book Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans From Colonial Times to the Present, Harriet Washington highlights the systemic experimentation of Black patients, including reproductive health.  Washington says that clinics fitted more African-American women than white women with intrauterine devices (IUDs).</p>   
      <p>&ldquo;The birth control pill was developed during an era in which abortion was still illegal, but laws prohibiting contraceptive use also remained in effect until the 1950s and the distribution of information about contraception was not legalized until 1971,&rdquo; Washington (p. 198) said in her book. &ldquo;Legal spermicidal creams and jellies are expensive, hard to obtain, and unreliable. So were the back-alley abortions from which thousands of women died horribly.&rdquo;</p>   
      <p>This spurred many thoughts that the Federal Government was attempting to stifle Black population growth.   &ldquo;A history of forcible sterilization fed suspicions that the federally financed birth-control clinics in their neighborhoods were attempts to discover the best way to limit or even erase the black presence in America,&rdquo; Washington said (p.198).</p>
      <blockquote>
        I do not want to be the change I want to see in this world.
      </blockquote>

      <p>There are not many resources for Black men who are suffering from infertility. As a matter of fact, how little is available is quite jarring. So jarring in fact, that the only Black man I was able to speak to for this issue chose to remain anonymous for this.</p>   
      <p>The anonymous person is an educator in the southern United States. He says it is important for him to remain anonymous because he does not want his infertility to be the defining point in his life.</p>   
      <p>&ldquo;It's something that's unknown. I don't want to say it's necessarily taboo, but people fear the unknown and I just don't want to be labeled and seen as different or have people feel sorry for me,&rdquo; he says. I don't want to be the spokesperson or the African American male infertility &ldquo;go-to guy&rdquo;. People say &lsquo;you should be the change that you want to be.&rsquo; And so, no, there wasn't information out there for me when I was at the peak of my frustrations, but I'm just not ready to be there for somebody else, either.&rdquo;</p>   
      <p>In spite of him not being quite ready to fully share his story, he wants there to be a conversation around the topic in order for Black men to gain help and resources.</p>   
      <p>&ldquo;I would definitely love for African American male infertility to be a topic of discussion, and for there to be light brought to the issue,&rdquo; he says.</p>

      <p>What's important to get across here is that his family thinks they are supportive, but Jared feels otherwise. His mother is open minded and gives money when needed, but never asks about the process because "it's none of her business."</p>
      
      <p>His father on the other hand personifies the stereotype of "we don't talk about that here." He is still unsure if he believes Jared is infertile, and refuses to talk about it unless directly confronted. As the audio clip will show, he will make excuses to get out of the conversation. He wouldn't talk about it with anyone, and he can't understand why Jared is doing this for his capstone and announcing it to the world.</p>

      <h3>A Child Like Me / Sperm Bank Disparity</h3>

      <p>38.</p>    
      <p>That number will come into play shortly.</p>   
      <p>My wife came home one day with information on sperm banks in the event we needed to find a sperm donor as an option. Upon looking at four of the major sperm banks in the country, we noticed something very jarring.   
      </p> My wife is white and I am Black, so we wanted a child that looks like us, but that road was going to be an uphill climb. At a glance of the donor information, we found that there were a vast amount of white donors to examine, with numbers into the thousands.</p>   
      <p>The number of black donors we found. 38. How could that be so low?</p>

      <p>Michelle Ottey, laboratory director for Fairfax Cryobank, says that there are immense difficulties stemming from communities of color as it even pertains to considering becoming a sperm donor.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It's just really difficult to even get guys to want to talk about it. And then there seems to be a lot of skepticism about it, like, &lsquo;seems sketchy&rsquo; or &lsquo;not so much&rsquo;. Like just not really getting it in terms of the need. And I think a lot of that is because there's not enough conversation about it. And maybe because people don't realize how much need and desire there is for people, you know, to build their families with donors that look like them with donors that share their cultural heritage, their ethnic background.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>When it comes to IVF, cost is a barrier for people of color.</h3>

      <p>Through my two surgeries, my wife and I were fortunate to have 6 embryos for use in our IVF process. I am in a fortunate position because my insurance plan is very good for fertility treatments, but for many this is not reality.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, those in medical circles like urologist Dr. Joseph Alukal of Columbia Presbyterian say this is a conversation among his community.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;A lot of colleagues I'm really proud of around the country who've been looking at issues of access to fertility care, issues of insurance coverage for fertility care, and the obvious kind of the disproportionate burden that's borne by patients of color in terms of not having the same access to fertility coverage to their insurance, not being able to pay out of pocket for procedures,&rdquo; he said. And so, you know, I think we're all correctly banging the drum about trying to figure out, you know, what do we do to make this kind of care, access to needs to be more equitable?</p>   
      
      <p>If I did not have insurance, I would have paid $50,000 out of pocket for them to just tell me what my problem was. Nearly another $55,000 went into one procedure.</p>

I am also hopeful that more resources can be made available for anyone interested so they can know of the help that can and is available to them.</p>
